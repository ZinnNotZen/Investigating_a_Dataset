### Description
This project takes data imported from tmbd-movies.csv to answer:"How has the amount of movies released a year changed over time" and"Is the popularity of movies getting better or worse? "
It does this by exporing and cleaning the data, then by analysing it. we use statistial commands (.min, .max, ect) to find statists and then created visualizations with the help of jupyter notebook and a combination of plotting._timeseries, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.
### Files used

Each of these categories are very important for learning about how the movie did and it can give some insight on why it did so well or so poorly. For example, the columns giving the id, IMBD id, and original title are identifiers so people can find the movie they are looking for or so they can know what movie information they are looking at. Columns like cast, homepage, director, tagline, keywords, movie overview, runtime, genre, production companies and production companies are ways to learn about the movie its self, who helped make it and what is that movie about. While the columns budget, release date, release year, and adjusted budget are more details about the movie that the main population of people may not want or need to know about. Then the columns popularity, revenue, vote count, vote average, and adjusted revenue can help show you how successful the movie w\n
